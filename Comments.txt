CSVs interesting facts:

*Data not normalized over more files
*One postal community can have multiple political communities
*Based on the csv data loader KTKZ is the canton code, vs GDEKT. I was unable to verify elsewhere, but they should probably use the same name.

Other:
Changed interfaces to classes to use @builder and @value which give us nice immutable objects.

First time using plantuml, unfortunately was not able get it to work with more than one relationship (syntax error).

Since we are loading this data in memory I would use hashmaps instead of sets to store the data. Memory usage is the same, but we get a free index.
We can have functions that return the sets if we want to. Even if we take a bit longer to build our data, we will have worthwhile gains in performance when running.

I would index some of the reverse relationships in memory to avoid doing O(n) operations all the time.
